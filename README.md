How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are basically descriptions of product features. They identify the relative priority and size of the project in relation to other user stories within the project, the type of end user of the product, what the client wants to be able to accomplish, and why. They provide just enough detail to provide the development team with a basic set of product requirements and no more. According to agile philosophy, there is no need to rigorously layout all of the project requirements in detail before beginning work on the project. Rather, the scrum team gets a good idea of what the client, such as by means of focus groups or surveys, and then begins straightaway, making refinements to the requirements on an as needed basis. Arguably, this eliminates waste and leads to faster product release. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have to admit that I do not particularly enjoy the planning phase of my coding projects. Yes, it is important to plan and have a basic idea of what the program is to do, and some basic pseudocode and/or a flowchart can be very helpful to these ends. But in line with agile principles, I would argue that it is best to get started on the actual code when just enough of a picture has been laid out. It seems to me that some people get very carried away with developing very fine grained psuedocode and very detailed flowcharts. This strikes me as waste. I prefer to keep it simple and get coding.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Transparency is probably one of the most important themes that has come up in the course of studying agile and scrum. A good team member will let others know when they break their code and need help fixing it, for example. Likewise, a good team member will reciprocate that assistence when the shoe is on the other foot. Hiding misunderstandings, failures, or limitations in ability doesn't help improve the quality of product nor does it help to speed up the release of the product. Rather, it slows down the work of the team. So my advice is to ask for help when needed and provide help when you are asked and able. This is the whole point of working on a team.
